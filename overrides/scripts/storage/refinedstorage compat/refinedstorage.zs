/*
No, RS will never be in the pack by default.
This is here just in case someone does decide to add it and use it (so that the recipes are greg-ified).
If you're reading this now, please do not use RS.
It causes major issues with autocrafting wires, it'll crash the pack.
Read up on https://github.com/OmnifactoryDevs/Omnifactory/issues/748 to learn more.

NOTE:
NO SUPPORT WILL BE OFFERED IF THIS MOD IS IN YOUR PACK.
