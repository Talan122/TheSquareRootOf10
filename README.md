# The Square Root Of 10
The Square Root of 10 is a Gregtech progression-based pack around the Community Edition and the addon Gregicality, with a bit of exploration thrown in there. For the most part though, it is tech based.

With many quests, as well as some difficult mobs and enemies, this pack certainly is not easy.

Current version: Alpha 0.0.2

Questline is currently at the Primitive Blast Furnace.
