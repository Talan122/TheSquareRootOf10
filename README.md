# The Square Root Of 10
![background](/background.png)
The Square Root of 10 is a modpack based around the Gregtech Community Edition and the addon Gregicality, which in it of itself has hundreds of hours of gameplay to go through. With our questbook to help guide you through both mods, as well as additional mods, like Applied Energistics 2. A bit of exploration is also thrown in to help mix it up a little bit, with mods like The Twilight Forest.

The pack right now is still in a very much early-alpha state. Updates are being posted to github in the form of commits, with occasional version updates on Curse.

It is also a very light pack, requiring as little as 2GB of ram to run (Subject to change)
